Notes to Include in Report

Assumptions
1. We aren't accounting for words that can act as different parts of speech, such as book (noun) vs book (verb), differently, so "book" would just inserted into the trump_dictionary based on its existence in the dictionary we already have (with whatever part of speech is selected first)
2. Words are compared case-insensitively (we cast all words to lower-case)
